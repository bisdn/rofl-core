What it is
==========

The Revised OpenFlow Library (ROFL) helps you adding OpenFlow support to your software to build control applications, controller frameworks and/or data path elements.

Requirements
============

- A modern GNU build-system (autoconf, automake, libtool, ...)
- GNU/Linux and libc development headers (linux-libc-dev and libc6-dev package in Debian/Ubuntu systems)
- [optional] if you want to run automatic tests (make check), libcunit and libcppunit are required (in libcunit1-dev and libcppunit-dev packages in Debian-like systems).
- [optional] Doxygen to generate the documentation.

How to build
============

Install the dependencies and run:

sh# ./autogen.sh
sh# cd build
sh# ../configure
sh# make

Optionally you can 'make check' for consistency checks.

Optional ../configure parameters
================================

--enable-debug: Compile with debug symbols (-g) and debug output (warning, it may affect performance).
--enable-verbose: Increase the level of debug (useless without --enable-debug)
--disable-silent-rules: Enable verbose compilation mode (AM_SILENT_RULES disabled)
--with-doc: Generate documentation along with compilation (for ROFL-common, ROFL-pipeline and ROFL-afa). Configure step will fail if doxygen is not found

FAQ
===

Some distributions, in particular Red Hat based, do not include by default /usr/local/lib on the search path of ldconfig, not allowing to link against -lrofl and -lrofl_pipeline. In this case, you might have to add /usr/local/lib/ into /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig.
