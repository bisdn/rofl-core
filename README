What it is
==========

The Revised OpenFlow Library (ROFL) helps you adding OpenFlow support to your software to build control applications, controller frameworks and/or datapath elements.

This is a meta-repository that contains all the ROFL libraries. Refer to each library for more details on how to build and install.

Compilation
===========

To compile the libraries initialize all submodules like:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

And for each of them proceed according to their README to install them.
