[B][pipeline] Fixed bug in the destruction of of1x_stats_group_desc_msg_t

v0.5.0

[+][common] Improved OF1.3 support and other fixes
[+][common] Set more useful defaults for cofmsg (e.g. OFP_NO_BUFFER for buffer-id)

[+][examples] Improved ethswctld, now supporting OF1.0, OF1.2 and OF1.3 simultaneously 


v0.4.6

[B][pipeline] Fixed bug during OUTPUT action for unknown ports, that could lead to a leakage of PKTs in exceptional situations.

v0.4.5

[B][pipeline] Fixed critical bug in __of1x_destroy_all_entries_from_timer_group() leading to a memory corruption

v0.4.4

[B][common] cmacaddr: use right macros in sscanf #29 

[B][pipeline] Fixed critical bug in __of1x_get_time_ms() for 32bit compilers leading to dead-lock in timers.

v0.4.3

[B][common] Fixed bug for match ARP_THA used invalid constants for OXM type 
[B][common] cofmatch.h: added method get_ipv6_flabel_value() and get_ipv6_flabel_mask(), according to spec
[B][common] Minor changes to coxmatch.h
[B][common] cofportstatsarray: corrected minor issue in output operator 
[B][common] cofmsg_flow_removed::unpack(): invalid length for unpacking matches 
[B][common] caddress.h: added missing dump of port number #11 
[B][common] Fixed preconditions for nw_tos and nw_proto in OF1.0 #2(reopened) 

[B][pipeline] Fixed bug in __of1x_process_instructions(), WRITE_METADATA corrected  
[B][pipeline] Fixed metaports for multi-process deployments
[B][pipeline] Fixed bug in __of1x_dump_matches() for IPV6_FLABEL

v0.4.2

[K] Automake 1.4 compilation. Please refer to the README.

[B][common] Fixed bug cofactions in method append_action()
[B][pipeline] Fixed compilation issues for 32 bit systems

v0.4.1

[K] Automake 1.4 compilation. Please refer to the README.

[B][common] OpenFlow 1.0.1 clarified handling of wildcards #2
[B][common] Fixed bug in port stats for OFP1.2; corrected length check

[+][pipeline] Async APIs not shown in doxygen documentation #1

v0.4.0
v0.4RC2

[K] Automake 1.4 compilation. Please refer to the README.

[+][hal] Improved doxygen documentation 

[+][pipeline] Improved doxygen documentation 
[+][pipeline] Unified the criteria used to align matches and actions in the pipeline. Changed constructors to use Host Byte Order. 

v0.4RC1

[K] Automake 1.4 compilation. Please refer to the README.

[+] Change in the build system. Documentation is compiled via 'make doc'.

[+][common] Added a new frame class for L2TPv3 (RFC3931): fl2tpv3frame to rofl/common/protocols
[+][common] Added a new logging concept in rofl/common/logging.h: 8 output streams exist
    for levels emerg, alert, crit, error, warn, info, notice, debug whose
    destinations can be freely configured
[B][common] Fixed a bug in handling of OXM TLVs of type VLAN_VID
[+][common] Added namespaces for OFP versions 1.0, 1.2, 1.3
[+][common] Revised workflow and split of crofdpt_impl and crofctl_impl
[+][common] New logging subsystem
[B][common] Fixed a bug in reverse mapping of pipeline matches to OXM-TLVs
[+][common] Reimplementation of main io loop in ciosrv
    - semantics of timer support haven changed
    - each timer is referred to by a uint32_t timer_id assigned by the cioloop IO subsystem
    - canceling or resetting timers must be done using this timer_id, the opaque value cannot
      be used anymore
[+][common] Added experimental OF13 support to various statistics classes including support for duration fields
[+][common] Added experimental OpenSSL support 
[+][common] Refactored crofbase interface. 

[+][hal] Renamed old Abstract Forwarding API (afa) to Hardware Abstraction Layer (hal). Renamed Forwarding module(fwd_module) to Driver (driver)

[+][pipeline] Changed pipeline to work in Network Byte Order (NBO). 
[+][pipeline] Split Packet Processing API calls from other headers, and distributed via "_pp.h" headers to enable inlining.
[+][pipeline] Refactored pipeline platform interfaces. 
[+][pipeline] Added monitoring support. 
[+][pipeline] Added flow_mod fast validation against flow table and group table capabilities
[+][pipeline] Added support for send_len on OUTPUT actions to CONTROLLER meta-port 
[B][pipeline] Fixed VLAN (present/not present) behaviour (all versions) 
[B][pipeline] Fixed several bugs for OF1.0 behaviour 


v0.3.4
